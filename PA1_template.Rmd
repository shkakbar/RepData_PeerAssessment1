Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:

- Dataset: Activity monitoring data [52K]
- The variables included in this dataset are: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

## Assignment

This assignment will be described in multiple parts. You will need to write a report that answers the questions detailed below. Ultimately, you will need to complete the entire assignment in a single R markdown document that can be processed by knitr and be transformed into an HTML file. 
Throughout your report make sure you always include the code that you used to generate the output you present. When writing code chunks in the R markdown document, always use echo = TRUE so that someone else will be able to read the code. This assignment will be evaluated via peer assessment so it is essential that your peer evaluators be able to review the code for your analysis. For the plotting aspects of this assignment, feel free to use any plotting system in R (i.e., base, lattice, ggplot2)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Load Libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
```

# Set Working folder and load file
```{r}
setwd("../Activity monitoring from fitness devices/")
dfactivities <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

# Check head, tail, structure, class and statistical summary about the data
```{r}
head(dfactivities)
tail(dfactivities)
str(dfactivities)
class(dfactivities)
summary(dfactivities)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day 
```{r}
steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, dfactivities, sum)

head(steps_by_day, 10)
str(steps_by_day)
```

2. Check Data normality
```{r}
shapiro.test(steps_by_day$steps)
```
From the output, the p-value > 0.05 implying that the distribution of the data are not significantly different from normal distribution. In other words, we can assume the normality.

3. Create Histogram on steps per day
```{r}
hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="green",xlab="Number of Steps")
```

4. Show average(mean) and median number of steps taken during the day
```{r}
rmean <- mean(steps_by_day$steps)
rmean

rmedian <- median(steps_by_day$steps)
rmedian

paste("Mean is:", format(rmean,2), "Medien is:", format(rmedian,2), sep = " ")
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Calculate average steps for each interval for all days
```{r}
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, dfactivities, mean)
```

2. Plot the Average Number Steps per Day by Interval
```{r}
plot(steps_by_interval$interval,steps_by_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")
```

3. Find interval with most average steps
```{r}
stpbyinterval <- steps_by_interval[which.max(steps_by_interval$steps),1]

paste("Interval with most steps is ", format(stpbyinterval,2), sep = " ")
```


## Imputing missing values

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data. 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs) 2. Using Mean for the day compute missing values 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in. 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

1. Check total number of missing values in the dataset
```{r}
missingvalues <- sum(is.na(dfactivities)) # OR sum(!complete.cases(dfactivities))

paste("Total Number of Missing values are", missingvalues, sep = " ")
```

2. Using Mean for the day compute missing values
```{r}
StepsAverage <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = dfactivities, FUN = mean)
fillNA <- numeric()
for (i in 1:nrow(dfactivities)) {
    obs <- dfactivities[i, ]
    if (is.na(obs$steps)) {
        steps <- subset(StepsAverage, interval == obs$interval)$steps
    } else {
        steps <- obs$steps
    }
    fillNA <- c(fillNA, steps)
}
```

3. Create a new dataset including the imputed missing values

```{r}
new_activity <- dfactivities
new_activity$steps <- fillNA
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
```{r}
StepsTotalUnion <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = new_activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(StepsTotalUnion$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps")
#Create Histogram to show difference. 
hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="green", xlab="Number of Steps", add=T)
legend("topright", c("Imputed", "Non-imputed"), col=c("blue", "green"), lwd=10)
```

5. Calculate Mean
```{r}
rmeantotal <- mean(StepsTotalUnion$steps)
rmeantotal
```

6. Calculate Median
```{r}
rmediantotal <- median(StepsTotalUnion$steps)
rmediantotal
```

7. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?
```{r}
rmediandiff <- rmediantotal - rmedian
rmediandiff

rmeandiff <- rmeantotal - rmean
rmeandiff
```

Ans. The mean(Mean Var: 0) is the same however the median does have a small variance(Median Var:1.1886792). between the total which includes the missing values to the base
What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
On observation the impact of the missing data has the biggest effect on the 10000 - 150000 step interval and changes frequency from 27.5 to 35 a variance of 7.5


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Created a plot to compare and contrast number of steps between the week and weekend. There is a higher peak earlier on weekdays, and more overall activity on weekends.

```{r}
weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
new_activity$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(new_activity$date)),weekdays), "Weekday", "Weekend"))
StepsTotalUnion <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, new_activity, mean)

xyplot(StepsTotalUnion$steps ~ StepsTotalUnion$interval|StepsTotalUnion$dow, main="Average Steps per Day by Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l")
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
